# Mini-Project-ClientLanding

I created this website for The Plant Lady to be a landing page and to provide contact information to The Plant Lady. She wanted semantic site with at least 3 colors, navigation that stays fixed to the top and also includes a quick jump to the contact info form, a header and footer, and to be posted live on GitHub.
